different types of social engineering techniques \u00b6 Phishing \u00b6 ~ social engineering with a touch of spoofing (email, text, etc) check the URL! usually something wrong (spelling, font, graphics) Tricks typosquatting https://bancasampaolo.com prepending: https://bbancasanpaolo.com pretexting lying to get information (eg. we\u2019re calling from Visa regarging\u2026) Pharming poisoned DNS server or client vulnerabilities everybody will be automatically redirected to the attacker\u2019s web sites combined with phishing: pharming: harvest large groups of people phishing: collect access credentials difficult for anti-malware and peple to detect relatively rare Vishing (voice phishing) spoofed phone number Smishing (sms phishing) forwards links or ask for personal information Finding the best spot to phish - Spear phishing targeted to specific people spear phishing the CEO is \u201cwhaling\u201d possible great catch eg social networks, corporate web sites where you work where you bank recent financial transactions family and friends Impersonation \u00b6 usually start with pretext, an actor and a story often with vishing psychological techniques examples: Hello sir, my name is Wendy and I\u2019m from Microsoft Windows. This is an urgent check up call for your computer as we have found several problems with it. Voice mail: This is an enforcement action executed by the US Treasury intending your serious attention. Congratulations on your excellent payment history! You now qualify for 0% interest rates on all of your credit card accounts. Plan pretend to be someone else use of those details from reconnaissance person high in rank throw tons of technical details be a buddy identity fraud bank fraud credit card fraud loan fraud government/tax fraud Protection never volunteer information don\u2019t disclose personal details always verify identity (through third parties) encourage verification Dumpster diving \u00b6 mobile garbage bin important information thrown out with trash gather details timing is important Protection secure garbage (locking key) burn documents Shoulder surfing \u00b6 access to important information curiosity, industrial espionage, competitive advantage surprisingly easy coffee airport webcam, binoculars, office Protection control your input use privacy filters keep your monitor out of sight Hoaxes \u00b6 hoax: a threat that doesn\u2019t exist still consume a lot of resources often an email or social some hoaxes will take your money by maxing you eg buying a gift card equally time wasting as a \u201creal\u201d virus Protection consider the source cross reference check spam filter is operating if it sounds too good to be true Watering hole attack \u00b6 if you have a secure network the attacker may go to a third party that you visit: the watering hole infect also your network where your users are visiting Protection defense-in-depth firewall and IPS anti virus - anti malware Spam \u00b6 Unsolicited messages email, forums spam over instant messaging (SPIM) Various content commercial advertising non commercial phishing attempts Significant technology issue managing the spam security resource utilisation Protection Mail gateway in front on the internal mail server Identitying spam allowed list: only from trusted sender SMTP standards checking: block anything that doesn\u2019t follow RFC standard rDNS: block email where the sender\u2019s domain doesn\u2019t match the IP address tarpitting: intentionally slow down the server conversation recipient filtering: block email not addressed to a valid recipient email address Influence campaigns \u00b6 hacking public opinion nation-state actors advertising is an option enabled through social media cyberwarfare: military strategy (not a new concept) influencing foreign elections fake news Process create fake users create content post on social medias amplify message real users share the message mass media picks up the story Other social engineering attacks \u00b6 Tailgating Use an authorized person to gain unauthorized access to a building blend in with clothing most security stops at the border Protection policy for visitors (eg badges) one scan one person access control vestibule / airlock don\u2019t be afraid to ask Invoice scam starts with a bit os spear phishing attacker sends a face invoice from a spoofed address of the CEO might also include links to pay Credential harvesting also called password harvesting there are a lot of stored credentials in the computer a program need to run on your local machine (eg malicious docx document) everything may happen in the background Principles of social engineering \u00b6 constantly changing may involve multiple people may be in person or electronic Principles: authority intimidation consensus / social proof scarcity urgency familiarity / liking trust Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators to determine the type of attack \u00b6 An overview of malware \u00b6 malicious software gather information (keystroke) participate in a group (botnet) show you advertising viruses and worm (pay for decryption) Malware types and method: Viruses Crypto-malware Ransomware Worms Trojan Horse Rootkit Keylogger Adware/Spyware Botnet How you get malware A worm takes advantage of a vulnerability Installs malware that includes a remote access backdoor Bot may be installed later Your computer must run a program Email link - Don\u2019t click links Web page pop-up Drive-by download Worm Your computer is vulnerable Operating system - Keep your OS updated! Applications - Check with the publisher Viruses and Worms \u00b6 Malware that can reproduce itself it needs you to execute a program Reproduces through file systems or the network Just running a program can spread a virus May or may not cause problems Some viruses are invisible, some are annoying Anti-virus is very common Thousands of new viruses every week Is your signature file updated? Virus types Program viruses it\u2019s part of the application Boot sector viruses Who needs an OS? Script viruses Operating system and browser-based Macro viruses Common in Microsoft Office Fileless viruses Does a good job of avoiding anti-virus detection Operates in memory But never installed in a file or application Worms Malware that self- replicates Doesn\u2019t need you to do anything Uses the network as a transmission medium Self-propagates and spreads quickly Worms are pretty bad things Can take over many systems very quickly Firewalls and IDS/IPS can mitigate many worm infestations Doesn\u2019t help much once the worm gets inside Ransomware and Crypto- malware \u00b6 Ransomware Personal data Family pictures and videos Important documents Organization data Planning documents Employee personally identifiable information (PlI) Financial information Company private data How much is it worth? There\u2019s a number The bad guys want your money They\u2019ll take your computer in the meantime May be a fake ransom Locks your computer \u201cby the police\u201d The ransom may be avoided A security professional may be able to remove these kinds of malware Crypto- malware A newer generation of ransomware Your data is unavailable until you provide cash Malware encrypts your data files Pictures, documents, music, movies, etc. Your OS remains available They want you running, but not working You must pay the bad guys to obtain the decryption key Untraceable payment system An unfortunate use of public-key cryptography Protection Always have a backup An offline backup, ideally Keep your operating system up to date Patch those vulnerabilities Keep your applications up to date Security patches Keep your anti- virus/anti-malware signatures up to date New attacks every hour Keep everything up to date Trojan and RATs \u00b6 Used by the Greeks to capture Troy from the Trojans A digital wooden horse Software that pretends to be something else So It can conquer your computer Doesn\u2019t really care much about replicating Circumvents your existing security Anti-virus may catch it when it runs The better Trojans are built to avoid and disable AV Once it\u2019s inside it has free reign And it may open the gates for other programs Potentially unwanted program (PUP) Identified by anti-virus/anti-malware Potentially undesirable software Often installed along with other software Overly aggressive browser toolbar A backup utility that displays ads ER Browser search engine hijacker Backdoors Why go through normal authentication methods? Just walk in the back door Often placed on your computer through malware Some malware software can take advantage of backdoors created by other malware Some software includes a backdoor (oops) Old Linux kernel included a backdoor Bad software can have a backdoor as part of the app Remote access trojans (RATs) Remote Administration Tool The ultimate backdoor Administrative control of a device Malware installs the server/service/host Bad guys connect with the client software Control a device Key logging Screen recording /screenshots Copy files Embed more malware Protection Don\u2019t run unknown software Consider the consequences Keep anti-virus/anti-malware signatures updated There are always new attacks Always have a backup You may need to quickly recover Rootkits \u00b6 Originally a Unix technique The \u201croot\u201d in rootkit Modifies core system files Part of the kernel Can be invisible to the operating system Won\u2019t see it in Task Manager Also invisible to traditional anti-virus utilities If you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t stop it Kernel drivers Zeus/Zbot malware Famous for cleaning out bank accounts Now combined with Necurs rootkit Necurs is a kernel-level driver Necurs makes sure you can\u2019t delete Zbot Access denied Trying to stop the Windows process? Error terminating process: Access denied Finding and removing rootkits Look for the unusual Anti-malware scans Use a remover specific to the rootkit Usually built after the rootkit is discovered Secure boot with UEFI Security in the BIOS won\u2019t boot if kernel is modified Spyware \u00b6 Your computer is one big advertisement Pop-ups with pop-ups May cause performance issues Especially over the network Installed accidentally May be included with other software Be careful of software that claims to remove adware Especially if you learned about it from a pop-up Malware that spies on you Advertising, identity theft, affiliate fraud Can trick you into installing Peer to peer, fake security software Browser monitoring Capture surfing habits W Keyloggers Capture every keystroke Send it back to the mother ship Why is there so much spyware and adware? Money Your eyeballs are incredibly valuable Your computer time and bandwidth is incredibly valuable Your bank account is incredibly valuable Yes, even your bank account Protection Maintain your anti-virus / anti-malware Always have the latest signatures Always know what you\u2019re installing And watch your options during the installation Where\u2019s your backup? You might need it someday Cleaning adware isn\u2019t easy Run some scans eg Malwarebytes Bots and botnets \u00b6 Robots Once your machine is infected, it becomes a bot You may not even know How does it get on your computer? Trojan Horse (I just saw a funny video of you! Click here.) Or You run a program or click an ad you THOUGHT was legit, but\u2026 OS or application vulnerability A day in the life of a bot Sit around. Check in with the Command and Control (C&C) server. Wait for instructions. Botnets A group of bots working together Nothing good can come from this Distributed Denial of service (DDoS) The power of many Relay spam, proxy network traffic, distributed computing tasks Botnets are for sale Rent time from the bad guys Not a long-term business proposition Protection Prevent the initial infection OS and application patches Anti-virus/anti-malware and updated signatures Identify an existing infection On-demand scans Network monitoring Prevent command and control (C&C) Block at the firewall Identify at the workstation with a host-based firewall or host-based IPS Logic bombs \u00b6 Waits for a predefined event Often left by someone with grudge Time bomb Time or date User event Logic bomb Difficult to identify Difficult to recover if it goes off Protection Difficult to recognize Each is unique No predefined signatures Process and procedures Formal change control Electronic monitoring Alert on changes Host-based intrusion detection, Tripwire, etc. Constant auditing An administrator can circumvent existing systems Password attacks \u00b6 Plaintext/unencrypted passwords Some applications store passwords \u201cin the clear\u201d No encryption. You can read the stored password. This is rare, thankfully Do not store passwords as plaintext Anyone with access to the password file or database has every credential What to do if your application saves passwords as plaintext: Get a better application Hashing a password Hashes represent data as a fixed-length string of text A message digest, or \u201cfingerprint\u201d Will not have a collision (hopefully) Different inputs will not have the same hash One-way trip Impossible to recover the original message from the digest A common way to store passwords Password file Different across operating systems and applications Different hash algorithms Spraying attack Try to login with an incorrect password Eventually you\u2019re locked out There are some common passwords https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_most_common_passwords Attack an account with the top three (or more) passwords If they don\u2019t work, move to the next account No lockouts, no alarms, no alerts Brute force Try every possible password combination until the a hash is matched This might take some time A strong hashing algorithm slows things down Brute force attacks - Online Keep trying the login process Very slow Most accounts will lockout after a number of failed attempts Brute force the hash - Offline Obtain the list of users and hashes Calculate a password hash, compare it to a stored hash Large computational resource requirement Dictionary attacks Use a dictionary to find common words Passwords are created by humans Many common wordlists available on the \u2018net Some are customized by language or line of work The password crackers can substitute letters p&sswOrd This takes time Distributed cracking and GPU cracking is common Discover passwords for common words This won\u2019t discover random character passwords Rainbow tables An optimized, pre-built set of hashes Saves time and storage space Doesn\u2019t need to contain every hash Contains pre-calculated hash chains Remarkable speed increase Especially with longer password lengths Need different tables for different hashing methods Windows is different than MySQL Adding some salt Salt:Random data added to a password when hashing Every user gets their own random salt The salt is commonly stored with the password Rainbow tables won\u2019t work with salted hashes Additional random value added to the original password This slows things down the brute force process It doesn\u2019t completely stop the reverse engineering (maybe they know the implementation of the salt) Each user gets a different random hash The same password creates a different hash Physical attacks \u00b6 Malicious USB cable It looks like a normal USB cable It has additional electronics inside Operating system identifies it as a HID Human Interface Device It looks like you\u2019ve connected a keyboard or mouse A keyboard doesn\u2019t need extra rights or permissions Once connected, the cable takes over Downloads and installs malicious software Don\u2019t just plug in any USB cable Always use trusted hardware Malicious USB cable Free USB flash drive! Plug it in and see what\u2019s on it That\u2019s a bad idea Older operating systems would automatically run files This has now been disabled or removed by default Could still act as a HID (Human Interface Device) / Keyboard Start a command prompt and type anything without your intervention Malicious USB cable Attackers can load malware in documents PDF files, spreadsheets Can be configured as a boot device Infect the computer after a reboot Acts as an Ethernet adapter Redirects or modifies Internet traffic requests Acts as a wireless gateway for other devices Never connect an untrusted USB device Skimming Stealing credit card information, usually during a normal transaction Copy data from the magnetic stripe: Card number, expiration date, card holder\u2019s name ATM skimming Includes a small camera to also watch for your PIN Attackers use the card information for other financial transactions Fraud is the responsibility of the seller Always check before using card readers Card cloning Get card details from a skimmer The clone needs an original Create a duplicate of a card Looks and feels like the original Often includes the printed CVC (Card Validation Code) Can only be used with magnetic stripe cards The chip can\u2019t be cloned Cloned gift cards are common A magnetic stripe technology Adversarial Artificial Intelligence \u00b6 Machine learning Our computers are getting smarter They identify patterns in data and improve their predictions This requires a lot of training data Face recognition requires analyzing a lot of faces Driving a car requires a lot of road time In use every day Stop spam Recommend products from an online retailer What movie would you like to see? This one. Prevent car accidents Poisoning the training data Confuse the artificial intelligence (Al) Attackers send modified training data that causes the Al to behave incorrectly Microsoft Al chatter bot named Tay (Thinking About You) Joins Twitter on March 23, 2016 Designed to learn by interacting with Twitter users Microsoft didn\u2019t program in anti-offensive behavior Tay quickly became racist, sexist, and inappropriate Evasion attacks The Al is only as good as the training Attackers find the holes and limitations An Al that knows what spam looks like can be fooled by a different approach Change the number of good and bad words in the message An Al that uses real-world information can release confidential information Trained with data that includes social security numbers Al can be fooled into revealing those numbers Securing the learning algorithm Check the training data Cross check and veritfy Constantly retrain with new data More data Better data Train the Al with possible poisoning What would the attacker try to do? Supply chain attack \u00b6 Supply chain The chain contains many moving parts Raw materials, suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, customers, consumers Attackers can infect any step along the way Infect different parts of the chain without suspicion People trust their suppliers One exploit can infect the entire chain There\u2019s a lot at stake Supply chain security Can you trust your new server/router/switch/firewall/software? Supply chain cyber security Use a small supplier base Tighter control of vendors Strict controls over policies and procedures Ensure proper security is in place Security should be part of the overall design There\u2019s a limit to trust Cloud based vs on-Premise attacks \u00b6 Two categories for IT security The on-premises data is more secure! The cloud-based data is more secure! Cloud-based security is centralized and costs less No dedicated hardware, no data center to secure A third-party handles everything On-premises puts the security burden on the client Data center security and infrastructure costs Attackers want your data They don\u2019t care where it is On-premises Customize your security posture Full control when everything is in-house On-site IT team can manage security better The local team can ensure everything is secure A local team can be expensive and difficult to staff Local team maintains uptime and availability System checks can occur at any time No phone call for support Security changes can take time New equipment, configurations, and additional costs Cloud Data Is In a secure environment No physical access to the data center Third-party may have access to the data Cloud providers are managing large-scale security Automated signature and security updates Users must follow security best-practices Limited downtime Extensive fault-tolerance and 24/7/365 monitoring Scalable security options One-click security deployments This may not be as customizable as necessary Cryptographyc attacks \u00b6 You\u2019\u2019ve encrypted data and sent it to another person Is it really secure? How do you know? The bad guy doesn\u2019t have the combination (the key) So they break the safe (the cryptography) Finding ways to undo the security There are many potential cryptographic shortcomings The problem is often the implementation Birthday attack In a classroom of 23 students, what is the chance of two students sharing a birthday? About 50% For a class of 30, the chance is about 70% In the digital world, this is a hash collision A hash collision is the same hash value for two different plaintexts Find a collision through brute force The attacker will generate multiple versions of plaintext to match the hashes Protect yourself with a large hash output size Collisions Hash digests are supposed to be unique Different input data should never create the same hash MDS5 hash Message Digest Algorithm 5 First published in April 1992 Collisions identified in 1996 December 2008: Researchers created CA certificate that appeared legitimate when MD5 is checked Built other certificates that appeared to be legit and issued by RapidSSL Downgrade attack Instead of using perfectly good encryption, use something that\u2019s not so great Force the systems to downgrade their security 2014 - TLS vulnerability POODLE (Padding Oracle On Downgraded Legacy Encryption) On-path attack Forces clients to fallback to SSL 3.0 SSL 3.0 has significant cryptographic vulnerabilities Because of POODLE, modern browsers won\u2019t fallback to SSL 3.0 Privilege escalation \u00b6 Gain higher-level access to a system Exploit a vulnerability Might be a bug or design flaw Higher-level access means more capabilities This commonly is the highest-level access This is obviously a concern These are high-priority vulnerability patches You want to get these holes closed very quickly Any user can be an administrator Horizontal privilege escalation User A can access user B resources Protection Patch quickly Fix the vulnerability Updated anti-virus/anti-malware software Block known vulnerabilities Data Execution Prevention Only data in executable areas can run Address space layout randomization Prevent a buffer overrun at a known memory address Given a scenario, analyze potential indicators associated with application attacks \u00b6 Cross-site Scripting (XSS) \u00b6 Originally called cross-site because of browser security flaws Information from one site could be shared with another One of the most common web application development errors Takes advantage of the trust a user has for a site Complex and varied Malware that uses JavaScript Do you allow scripts? Me too. Tokens should expire Non persistent (reflected) XSS attack Web site allows scripts to run in user input Search box is a common source Attacker emails a link that takes advantage of this vulnerability Runs a script that sends credentials/session IDs/cookies to the attacker Script embedded in URL executes in the victim\u2019s browser As if it came from the server Attacker uses credentials/session IDs/cookies to steal victim\u2019s information without their knowledge Very sneaky Persistent (stored) XSS attack Attacker posts a message to a social network Includes the malicious payload It\u2019s now \u201cpersistent\u201d Everyone gets the payload No specific target All viewers to the page For social networking, this can spread quickly Everyone who views the message can have it posted to their page Where someone else can view it and propagate it further\u2026 Protection Be careful when clicking untrusted links Never blindly click in your email inbox. Never. Consider disabling JavaScript Or control with an extension This offers limited protection Keep your browser and applications updated Avoid the nasty browser vulnerabilities Validate input Don\u2019t allow users to add their own scripts to an input field Injection attacks \u00b6 Code injection Code injection: Adding your own information into a data stream Enabled because of bad programming The application should properly handle input and output So many different data types HTML, SQL, XML, LDAP, etc. SQL injection SQL - Structured Query Language The most common relational database management system language XML injection and LDAP injection XML - Extensible Markup Language A set of rules for data transfer and storage XML injection Modifying XML requests - a good application will validate LDAP - Lightweight Directory Access Protocol Created by the telephone companies Now used by almost everyone LDAP injection Modify LDAP requests to manipulate application results DLL injection Dynamic-Link Library A Windows library containing code and data Many applications can use this library Inject a DLL and have an application run a program Runs as part of the target process Buffers overflows \u00b6 Overwriting a buffer of memory Spills over into other memory areas Developers need to perform bounds checking The attackers spend a lot of time looking for openings Not a simple exploit Takes time to avoid crashing things Takes time to make it do what you want A really useful buffer overflow is repeatable Which means that a system can be compromised Replay attacks \u00b6 Useful information is transmitted over the network A crafty hacker will take advantage of this Need access to the raw network data Network tap, ARP poisoning, Malware on the victim computer The gathered information may help the attacker Replay the data to appear as someone else This is not an on-path attack The actual replay doesn\u2019t require the original workstation eg: pass the hash Avoid this type of replay attack with a salt or encryption Use a session ID with the password hash to create a unique authentication hash each time Attacker captures authentication (Username and hashed password) Attacker sends his own authentication request using the previously captured information Username and hash match a valid account - attacker gains access Browser cookies and session IDs Cookies: Information stored on your computer by the browser Used for tracking, personalization, session management Not executable, not generally a security risk Unless someone gets access to them Could be considered be a privacy risk Lots of personal data in there Session IDs are often stored in the cookie Maintains sessions across multiple browser sessions Session hijacking (sidejacking) the attacker gains access of the session ID Use an encrypted protocol Header manipulation Information gathering Wireshark, Kismet Exploits Cross-site scripting Modify headers Tamper, Firesheep, Scapy Modify cookies Cookies Manager+ (Firefox add-on) Protection Encrypt end-to-end They can\u2019t capture your session ID if they can\u2019t see it Additional load on the web server (HTTPS) Firefox extension: HTTPS Everywhere, Force-TLS Many sites are now HTTPS-only Encrypt end-to-somewhere At least avoid capture over a local wireless network Still in-the-clear for part of the journey Personal VPN (OpenVPN, VyprVPN, etc.) Request forgeries \u00b6 Cross-site requests are common and legitimate You visit ProfessorMesser.com Your browser loads text from the ProfessorMesser.com server Your browser loads a video from YouTube Your browser loads pictures from Instagram HTML on ProfessorMesser.com directs requests from your browser This is normal and expected The client and the server Website pages consist of client-side code and server-side code Many moving parts Client side Renders the page on the screen HTML, JavaScript Server side Performs requests from the client HTML, PHP X Transfer money from one account to another Post a video on YouTube Cross-site request forgery One-click attack, session riding XSRF, CSRF (sea surf) Takes advantage of the trust that a web application has for the user The web site trusts your browser Requests are made without your consent or your knowledge Attacker posts a Facebook status on your account Significant web application development oversight The application should have anti-forgery techniques added Usually a cryptographic token to prevent a forgery Attacker creates a funds transfer request Request is sent as a hyperlink to a user who may already be logged into the bank web site Visitor clicks the link and unknowingly sends the transfer request to the bank web site Bank validates the transfer \u2019and sends the visitor\u2019s funds to the attacker Server-side request forgery (SSRF) Attacker finds a vulnerable web application Sends requests to a web server Web server performs the request on behalf of the attacker Caused by bad programming Never trust the user input Server should validate the input and the responses These are rare, but can be critical vulnerabilities how Attacker sends a request that controls a web application Web server sends request to another service, such as cloud file storage Cloud storage sends response to Web Server Web Server forwards response to attacker Driver manipulation \u00b6 Malware hide-and-go-seek Traditional anti-virus is very good at identifying known attacks Checks the signature Block anything that matches There are still ways to infect and hide It\u2019s a constant war Zero-day attacks, new attack types, etc. Drivers are powerful The interaction between the hardware and your operating system They are often trusted Great opportunity for security issues May 2016 - HP Audio Drivers Conexant audio chips Driver installation includes audio control software Debugging feature enables a keylogger Hardware interactions contain sensitive information Video, keyboard, mouse Shimming Filling in the space between two objects A middleman Windows includes it\u2019s own shim Backwards compatibility with previous Windows versions Application Compatibility Shim Cache Malware authors write their own shims Get around security (like UAC) January 2015 Microsoft vulnerability Elevates privilege Refactoring Metamorphic malware A different program each time it\u2019s downloaded Make it appear different each time Add NOP instructions Loops, pointless code strings Can intelligently redesign itself Reorder functions Modify the application flow Reorder code and insert unused data types Difficult to match with signature-based detection Use a layered approach SSL stripping \u00b6 Combines an on-path attack with a downgrade attack Difficult to implement, but big returns for the attacker Attacker must sit in the middle of the conversation Must modify data between the victim and web server Proxy server, ARP spoofing, rogue Wi-Fi hotspot, etc. Victim does not see any significant problem Except the browser page isn\u2019t encrypted Strips the S away from HTTPS This is a client and server problem Works on SSL and TLS how: On-path attack Rewrites URLs HTTP/HTTPS Protection Avoid non encrypted communication (stick to HTTPS) Race conditions \u00b6 A programming conundrum Sometimes, things happen at the same time This can be bad if you\u2019ve not planned for it Time-of-check to time-of-use attack (TOCTOU) Check the system When do you use the results of your last check?

Many different approaches Unknown environment The pentester knows nothing about the systems under attack \u201cBlind\u201d test Known environment Full disclosure Partially known environment A mix of known and unknown Focus on certain systems or applications Exploiting vulnerabilities Try to break into the system Be careful; this can cause a denial of service or loss of data Buffer overflows can cause instability Gain privilege escalation You may need to try many different vulnerability types Password brute-force Social engineering Database injections Buffer overflows You\u2019ll only be sure you\u2019re vulnerable if you can bypass security If you can get through, the attackers can get through The process Initial exploitation Get into the network Lateral movement Move from system to

Don\u2019t leave information out there Secure Coding Techniques \u00b6 Secure coding concepts A balance between time and quality Programming with security in mind is often secondary Testing, testing, testing The Quality Assurance (QA) process Vulnerabilities will eventually be found And exploited Stored procedures SQL databases Client sends detailed requests for data \u2019SELECT * FROM wp_ options WHERE option_id =1\u2019 Client requests can be complex And sometimes modified by the user This would not be good Stored procedures limit the client interactions \u2019CALL get_options\u2019 That\u2019s it. No modifications to the query are possible. To be really secure, use only stored procedures The application doesn\u2019t use any SQL queries Obfuscation/camouflage Obfuscate Make something normally understandable very difficult to understand Take perfectly readable code and turn it into nonsense The developer keeps the readable code and gives you the chicken scratch Both sets of code perform exactly the same way Helps prevent the search for security holes Makes it more difficult to figure out what\u2019s happening But not impossible Code reuse/dead code Code reuse Use old code to build new applications Copy and paste If the old code has security vulnerabilities, reusing the code spreads it to other applications You\u2019re making this much more difficult for everyone Dead code Calculations are made, code is executed, results are tallied The results aren\u2019t used anywhere else in the application All code is an opportunity for a security problem Make sure your code is as alive as possible Input validation What is the expected input? Validate actual vs. expected Document all input methods Forms, fields, type Check and correct all input (normalization) A zip code should be only X characters long with a letter in the X column Fix any data with improper input The fuzzers will find what you missed Don\u2019t give them an opening Validation points Server-side validation All checks occur on the server Helps protect against malicious users Attackers may not even be using your interface Client-side validation The end-user\u2019s app makes the validation decisions Can filter legitimate input from genuine users May provide additional speed to the user Use both But especially server-side validation Memory management As a developer, you must be mindful of how memory is used Many opportunities to build vulnerable code Never trust data input Malicious users can attempt to circumvent your code Buffer overflows are a huge security risk Make sure your data matches your buffer sizes Some built-in functions are insecure Use best practices when designing your code Third-party libraries and SDKs Your programming language does everything Almost Third-party libraries and software development kits Extend the functionality of a programming language Security risk Application code written by someone else Might be secure. Might not be secure. Extensive testing is required Balancing act Application features vs. unknown code base Data exposure So much sensitive data Credit card numbers, social security numbers, medical information, address details, email information How is the application handling the data? No encryption when stored No encryption across the network Displaying information on the screen All input and output processes are important Check them all for data exposure Version control Create a file, make a change, make another change, and another change Track those changes, revert back to a previous version Commonly used in software development But also in operating systems, wiki software, and cloud-based file storage Useful for security Compare versions over time Identify modifications to important files A security challenge Historical information can be a security risk Software diversity \u00b6 Exploiting an application Attackers often exploit application vulnerabilities They find the unlocked door and open it Once you exploit one binary, you can exploit them all The application works the same on all systems A Windows 10 exploit affects all Windows 10 users What if all of the computers were running different software? Unique binaries Functionally identical Software diversity Alternative compiler paths would result in a different binary each time Each compiled application would be a little bit different But functionally the same An attack against different binaries would only be successful on a fraction of the users An attacker wouldn\u2019t know what exploit to use Make the game much harder to win Automation and Scripting \u00b6 Plan for change Implement automatically Automated courses of action Many problems can be predicted Have a set of automated responses Continuous monitoring Check for a particular event, and then react Configuration validation Cloud-based technologies allow for constant change Automatically validate a configuration before going live Perform ongoing automated checks Continuous integration (CI) Code is constantly written And merged into the central repository many times a day So many chances for security problems Security should be a concern from the beginning Basic set of security checks during development Documented security baselines as the bare minimum Large-scale security analysis during the testing phase Significant problems will have already been covered Continuous delivery/deployment (CD) Continuous delivery Automate the testing process Automate the release process Click a button and deploy the application Continuous deployment Even more automation Automatically deploy to production No human integration or manual checks Summarize authentication and authorization design concepts \u00b6 Authentication Methods \u00b6 Attestation Prove the hardware is really yours A system you can trust Easy when it\u2019s just your computer More difficult when there are 1,000 Remote attestation Device provides an operational report to a verification server Encrypted and digitally sigrted with the TPM An IMEI or other unique hardware component can be included in the report Short message server (SMS) Text messaging Includes more than text these days Login factor can be sent via SMS to a predefined phone number Provide username and password Phone receives an SMS Input the SMS code into the login form Security issues exist Phone number can be reassigned to a different phon\u00e9 SMS messages can be intercepted Push notification Similar process to an SMS notification Authentication factor is pushed to a specialized app Usually on a mobile device Security challenges Applications can be vulnerable Some push apps send in the clear Still more secure than SMS Multiple factors are better than one factor Authentication apps Pseudo-random token generators A useful authentication factor Carry around a physical hardware token generator Where are my keys again?

practical applications Payment processing Digital identification Supply chain monitoring Digital voting The blockchain process A transaction is requested. The transaction could be any digital transaction from transferring Bitcoins, medical records, data backups, or transferring house title information. The transaction is sent to every computer (or node) in a decentralized network to be verified. The verified transaction is added to a new block of data containing other recently verified transactions. A secure code (a hash) is calculated from the previous blocks of transaction data in the Blockchain. The hash is added to the new block of verified transactions. The block is added to the end of the Blockchain, which is then updated to all nodes in the network for security. The transaction is complete. If any blocks are altered, its hash and all following hashes in the chain are automatically recalculated. The altered chain will not longer match the chains stored by the rest of the network, and will be rejected.

Dynamic KBA Questions are based on an identity verification service What was your street number when you lived in Pembroke Pines, Florida? PAP and CHAP \u00b6 PAP (Password Authentication Protocol) A basic authentication method Used in legacy operating systems Rare to see singularly used PAP is in the clear v Weak authentication scheme Non-encrypted password exchange We didn\u2019t require encryption on analog dialup lines The application would need to provide any encryption CHAP Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol Encrypted challenge sent over the network Three-way handshake After link is established, server sends a challenge message Client responds with a password hash calculated from the challenge and the password Server compares received hash with stored hash Challenge-Response continues Occurs periodically during the connection User never knows it happens MS-CHAP Microsoft\u2019s implementation of CHAP Used commonly on Microsoft\u2019s Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) MS-CHAP v2 is the more recent version Security issues related to the use of DES Relatively easy to brute force the 256 possible keys to decrypt the NTLM hash Don\u2019t use MS-CHAP! Consider L2TP, IPsec, 802.1X or some other secure authentication method Identity and access services \u00b6 RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-in User Service) One of the more common AAA protocols Supported on a wide variety of platforms and devices Not just for dial-in Centralize authentication for users Routers, switches, firewalls Server authentication Remote VPN access 802.1X network access RADIUS services available on almost any server operating system TACACS Terminal Access Controller Access-Control System Remote authentication protocol Created to control access to dial-up lines to ARPANET XTACACS (Extended TACACS) A Cisco-created (proprietary) version of TACACS Additional support for accounting and auditing TACACS+ The Iatesf version of TACACS, not backwards compatible More authentication requests and response codes Released as an open standard in 1993 Kerberos Network authentication protocol Authenticate once, trusted by the system No need to re-authenticate to everything Mutual authentication - the client and the server Protect against on-path or replay attacks Standard since the 1980s Developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Microsoft starting using Kerberos in Windows 2000 Based on Kerberos 5.0 open standard Compatible with other operating systems and devices SSO with Kerberos Authenticate one time Lots of backend ticketing Cryptographic tickets No constant username and password input! Save time Only works with Kerberos Not everything is Kerberos-friendly There are many other SSO methods Smart-cards, SAML, etc RADIUS, TACACS+, or Kerberos? Three different ways to communicate to an authentication server More than a simple login process Often determined by what is at hand VPN concentrator can talk to a RADIUS server We have a RADIUS

support Not an authentication protocol OpenlD Connect handles the single sign-on authentication OAuth provides authorization between applications Relatively popular Used by Twitter, Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, and more Access Control \u00b6 Authorization The process of ensuring only authorized rights are exercised Policy enforcement The process of determining rights Policy definition Users receive rights based on Access Control models Different business needs or mission requirements Mandatory Access Control (MAC) The operating system limits the operation on an object Based on security clearance levels Every object gets a label Confidential, secret, top secret, etc. Labeling of objects uses predefined rules The administrator decides who gets access te what security level Users cannot change these settings Discretionary Access Control (DAC) Used in most operating systems A familiar access control model You create a spreadsheet As the owner, you control who has access You can modify access at any time Very flexible access control And very weak security Role-based access control (RBAC) You have a role in your organization Manager, director, team lead, project manager Administrators provide access based on the role of the user Rights are gained implicitly instead of explicitly In Windows, use Groups to provide role-based access control You are in shipping and receiving, so you

Many different detection sources Different levels of detail, different levels of perception A large amount of \u201cvolume\u201d Attacks are incoming all the time How do you identify the legitimate threats? Incidents are almost always complex Extensive knowledge needed Incident precursors An incident might occur in the future This is your heads-up Web server log Vulnerability scanner in use Exploit announcement Monthly Microsoft patch release, Adobe Flash update Direct threats A hacking group doesn\u2019t like you Incident indicators An attack is underway Or an exploit is successful Buffer overflow attempt Identified by an intrusion detection/prevention system Anti-virus software identifies malware Deletes from OS and notifies administrator Host-based monitor detects a configuration change Constantly monitors system files Network traffic flows deviate from the norm Requires constant monitoring Isolation and containment Generally a bad idea to let things run their course An incident can spread quickly It\u2019s your fault at that point Sandboxes An isolated operating system Run malware and analyze the results Clean out the sandbox when done Isolation can be sometimes be problematic Malware or infections can monitor connectivity When connectivity is lost, everything could be deleted/encrypted/damaged Recovery after an incident Get things back to normal Remove the bad, keep the good Eradicate the bug Remove malware Disable breached user accounts Fix vulnerabilities Recover the system Restore from backups Rebuild from scratch Replace compromised files Tighten down the perimeter Reconstitution A phased approach It\u2019s difficult to fix everything at once Recovery may take months Large-scale incidents require a large amount of work The plan should be efficient Start with quick, high-value security changes Patches, firewall policy changes Later phases involve much \u201cheavier Ilf\u2019tmg Infrastructure changes, large-scale security rollouts Lessons learned Learn and improve No system is perfect Post-incident meeting Invite everyone affected by the incident Don\u2019t wait too long Memories fade over time Some recommendations can be applied to the next event Answer the tough questions What happened, exactly? Timestamp of the events How did your incident plans work? Did the process operate successfully? What would you do differently next time? Retrospective views provide context Which indicators would you watch next time? Different precursors may give you better alerts Incident response planning \u00b6 Exercise Test yourselves before an actual event Scheduled update sessions (annual, semi-annual, etc.) Use well-defined rules of engagement Do not touch the production systems Very specific scenario Limited time to run the event Evaluate response Document and discuss Tabletop exercises Performing a full-scale disaster drill can be costly And time consuming Many of the logistics can be determined through analysis You don\u2019t physically have to go through a disaster or drill Get key players together for a tabletop exercise Talk through a simulated disaster Walkthrough Include responders A step beyond a tabletop exercise Many moving parts Test processes and procedures before an event Walk through each step Involve all groups Reference actual response materials Identifies actual faults or missing steps The walkthrough applies the concepts from the tabletop exercise Simulation Test with a simulated event Phishing attack, password requests, data breaches Going phishing Create a phishing email attack Send to your actual user community See who bites Test internal security Did the phishing get past the filter? Test the users Who clicked? Additional training may be required Stakeholder management Keeping an good ongoing relationship with customers of IT These can be internal or external customers An incident response will require teamwork Without the stakeholder, IT would not exist Most of this happens prior to an incident Ongoing communication and meetings Exercises should include the customers Continues after the incident Prepare for the next event Communication plan Get your contact list together There are a lot of people in the loop Corporate / Organization CIO / Head of Information Security / Internal Response Teams Internal non-IT Human resources Public affairs Legal department External contacts System owner, law enforcement US-CERT (for U.S. Government agencies) Disaster recovery plan If a disaster happens, IT should be ready Part of business continuity planning Keep the organization up and running Disasters are many and varied Natural disasters Technology or system failures Human-created disasters A comprehensive plan Recovery location Data recovery method Application restoration IT team and employee availability Continuity of operations planning (COOP) Not everything goes according to plan Disasters can cause a disruption to the norm We rely on our computer systems Technology is pervasive There needs to be an alternative Manual transactions Paper receipts Phone calls for transaction approvals These must be documented and tested before a problem occurs Incident response team Receives, reviews, and responds A predefined group of professionals Determine what type of events require a response A virus infection?
